This Java program is a simplified version of the popular "Flappy Bird" game using the Swing library for GUI and basic game mechanics.

Concept:
In this game, a bird (represented by a rectangle) tries to fly through a series of pipes without hitting them. 
The player controls the bird's movement by pressing the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the bird "jump" upward. If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game ends. 
The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible to increase the score.

Code Explanation:

1. Class and Variables:
FlappyBird class implements ActionListener and KeyListener, handling game logic and user inputs.
Game Window dimensions: WIDTH = 1500 and HEIGHT = 800. These define the size of the game window.
Renderer: The Renderer class is a custom JPanel responsible for repainting the game window.
Rectangle bird: This represents the bird, initialized as a rectangle with position and size.
ArrayList<Rectangle> pipes: Stores all the pipes currently visible in the game.
Game states like ticks, yMotion, score, gameOver, and started manage the game's progress.
Random rand: Helps generate random heights for pipes.

2. Constructor (FlappyBird):
Creates the game window using JFrame, sets properties like title, size, and visibility.
Initializes the bird's position in the middle of the window and the list of pipes.
Starts a Timer that triggers the actionPerformed method every 10 milliseconds to update the game logic.

3. Pipes (addPipe):
This method adds pairs of pipes (one top, one bottom) to the game.
The space variable defines the gap between the pipes (350 pixels).
width and height define the dimensions of the pipes.
If start is true, pipes are added in a starting position. Otherwise, new pipes are added after the previous ones.

4. Jumping Logic (jump):
This method is called when the player presses the spacebar or the up arrow.
If the game is over, it resets the bird, clears the pipes, and restarts the game.
If the game has not started yet, the started flag is set to true.
When the bird jumps, its vertical motion (yMotion) is reduced (making it move upwards).

5. Game Update (actionPerformed):
Every time the Timer ticks, this method updates the game state.
Pipes move left by 8 pixels (speed), creating the illusion of forward movement.
If the pipes go off the screen, they are removed and new ones are added.
The bird's vertical position is adjusted by yMotion, which increases over time to simulate gravity.
Collision detection is performed by checking if the bird intersects with any pipes or goes out of bounds.
If the bird hits a pipe or goes out of the screen, the game ends, and a timer is set to close the game after 1 second.

6. Rendering (repaint):
The repaint method is responsible for drawing all the game elements on the screen.
It uses Graphics to draw:
A background with a sky and grass.
The bird, represented as a green rectangle.
The pipes, colored dark green.
Game messages and the score.

7. Key Inputs:
The keyPressed method listens for spacebar or up arrow key presses and triggers the jump method to move the bird upward.
keyReleased and keyTyped are not used in this program but are required by the KeyListener interface.

8. Game Over Logic:
If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, gameOver is set to true.
A new timer is started to close the game 1 second after a collision.


Modifications:
Pipe Gap: Increased to 350 pixels to make the game easier.
Bird Jump and Movement: Slowed down to make the bird's movement smoother and more controllable.
Exit Timer: Added a 1-second delay before closing the game when the bird hits a pipe or ground.
Background: The game background is styled as a peaceful nature scene, with a light blue sky and green grass.

Overall Game Flow:
The game starts with the bird stationary, waiting for the player to press space or the up arrow to begin.
Once started, pipes begin moving from right to left, and the bird falls due to gravity unless the player makes it jump.
The player earns points by successfully navigating through the gaps between pipes.
If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game ends, displaying a "Don't Quit" message before the game closes.

Future Improvements:
Add a restart option when the game ends instead of automatically closing.
Implement sound effects and more animations for the bird and background.
Add more complex game mechanics, such as increasing difficulty over time or introducing power-ups.
